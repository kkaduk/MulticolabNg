**Concise Briefing:**

- The Polish Parliament's lower house has adopted the Act on Crypto-Assets Market, indicating progress in MiCA's (Markets in Crypto-Assets) adoption process, but full adoption is yet to be completed. This demonstrates the country's efforts in regulating the crypto-assets markets [source](https://www.lawfirmpoland.com/mica-in-poland-update-october-2025/).

- There are strict regulatory expectations for directors applying for a CASP license in Poland under MiCA; they must demonstrate experience, regulatory awareness, and maintain a physical presence within the EU [source](https://www.lawfirmpoland.com/mica-in-poland-requirements-for-directors/). This might imply a thorough vetting process for potential CASP directors, thereby ensuring the integrity of the crypto-assets market.

- A significant development is the installation of an on-site crypto ATM in a legal practice, marking it as the first law firm in Poland to host such a device. This move reflects a growing acceptance and incorporation of crypto-assets in conventional business environments [source](https://www.lawfirmpoland.com/first-law-firm-in-poland-with-crypto-atm/).

**Emerging Themes:**

- AML Officer roles are emphasised, indicating a clear focus on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) systems in crypto-related institutions. This follows global concerns about the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities [source](https://www.lawfirmpoland.com/aml-officer-in-poland/).

**Recommended Actions:**

- Monitor closely how MiCA unfolds in Poland, particularly the specifics surrounding the Act on Crypto-Assets Market.
- Also, observe how the first law firm with a crypto ATM fares in the business and legal environment. This may influence the adoption of similar practices by other law firms.
- Future CASP license applicants must ensure they meet all requirements, including having substantial experience, understanding of regulatory standards, and maintaining a presence within the EU.

Poland appears to be taking a measured approach to cryptocurrency regulation through MiCA implementation, balancing innovation with consumer protection and compliance concerns. The regulatory framework is still evolving, with significant implications for market participants who will need to closely monitor further developments in implementation and enforcement.

### [Step 3] Identify risks in proposed ideas
# Risk Analysis of Cryptocurrency Banking Integration

## Regulatory and Compliance Risks

1. **Incomplete Regulatory Framework**

   - Possibility of divergent interpretations during early implementation stages

2. **Licensing Risks**
   - Stringent director and leadership requirements may create recruitment challenges
   - Physical presence requirements in EU could increase operational costs
   - Potential delays in licensing approvals affecting time-to-market

3. **AML/CFT Compliance Failure Risks**
   - High penalties for non-compliance with AML/CFT regulations

- Comprehensive staff training programs on crypto-specific risks
- Robust testing frameworks before full-scale implementation

### [Step 4] Create a refined idea for a new banking product
## New Banking Product Idea: Secure Crypto-Asset Management (SCAM) Platform

Given the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency and the increasing regulatory clarity in Poland, the bank should consider the development of a new product termed as the Secure Crypto-Asset Management (SCAM) Platform. This innovative platform would offer customers secure, regulatory-compliant services to store, invest and trade a range of cryptocurrencies.

### Product Features:

1. **Diverse Crypto Portfolio Management**: The SCAM Platform will allow customers to invest in, hold and manage a diverse portfolio of regulated cryptocurrencies, helping them diversify their investment portfolio.

2. **Seamless Transaction Capabilities**: Customers would be able to conduct smooth transactions between their fiat and crypto accounts within the bank, offering an all-in-one solution for both traditional and digital asset management.

3. **Secure Crypto Wallet**: Leveraging our existing technological prowess and security measures, the platform will provide secure storage of cryptocurrencies, effectively acting as a 'crypto wallet'. It will include advanced features such as private key encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: In line with the evolving MiCA implementation in Poland, the SCAM platform will adhere to all relevant regulatory frameworks, particularly in areas of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).

5. **Risk Management Tool**: Customers can leverage embedded risk management tools to assess their exposure to volatile crypto-assets, avoid asset devaluation and maintain optimal portfolio balance.

6. **Market Insights and Analysis**: The platform will provide real-time data, expert analysis and insights about the latest crypto market trends, thereby helping customers make informed decisions.

### Mitigation Strategies:

- To mitigate regulatory and compliance risks, collaborate with regulatory authorities and ensure full adherence to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations.
- To manage operational risks, partner with technology providers with proven solutions in the cryptocurrency market.
- Establish rigorous security protocols and standards to minimize cyber threats and ensure safe custody of digital assets.
- To tackle market and financial risks, inform and educate customers about the volatility of the crypto market.
- Maintain open communication channels with customers to increase transparency and manage reputational risks
- To address strategic risks, conduct regular customer surveys and feedback sessions to understand their preferences and enhance the product accordingly.

With SCAM Platform, the bank could attract a new customer segment, enhance customer engagement, generate new revenue streams, and position itself as a frontrunner in the burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape in Poland.

### [Step 5] Finalize the idea for the new banking product
To finalize the product idea for the Secure Crypto-Asset Management (SCAM) Platform as the new banking product, the focus will be on firstly, providing regulatory-compliant and diverse cryptocurrency services that ensure the customers can safely invest, store and trade a variety of digital currencies. Secondly, implementing a secure and efficient solution for transactions involving both traditional and digital currencies.

Key features to include in this platform would be secure currency storage, advanced private key encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options. Important measures to ensure full regulatory compliance in accordance with MiCA, AML and CFT regulations should also be incorporated.

The SCAM platform should offer risk management tools for customers to manage their portfolio balance while preventing asset devaluation. This platform would also provide market insights and expert analysis on the current trends and movements in the crypto market.

Mitigation strategies should be developed to counter regulatory, compliance, operational, market, financial, reputational and strategic risks. This involves collaboration with regulators, partnerships with technology providers, implementation of robust security protocols, customer education on crypto market volatility and transparency in communication. Regular customer feedback should also be maintained for continuous product enhancement.

With the SCAM Platform, the bank will invite a new customer base, strengthen customer engagement, and provide new avenues for growth and revenue. Furthermore, it will set the bank apart as a progressive leader in the growing Polish cryptocurrency market.
